      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        People will come to my site. Because they are curious about Korean
        webtoons. Typically, those who enjoy comics always want to find
        interesting ones to read. This is because the speed of updates for
        comics canâ€™t keep up with the speed that people read them. In this
        situation, Korean webtoons are great content for those who love comics,
        and people will visit my site to find information. Visitors will want to
        search for Korean webtoons that match their interests, based on genre
        and descriptions. The reason why visitors choose my site rather than
        others is my site is the only site that introduces Korean webtoons.
